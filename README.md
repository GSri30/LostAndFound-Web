> This is my first website made using django. It is a &#34;Lost And Found&#34; website which can be used to either report or view the lost and found things. Losing things is very common for us, which made me to start this project :)
> Things that are left to do further:
  > Add an optionality to delete a lost or found form (only when the user is logged in)
  > Add a comments session (in lost things list and found things list page) wherein people can specify whose thing it is (if they know)
  > Make an email verification while registering
> and so on... Please edit this if you got any new feature idea :)
