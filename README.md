> This is my first website made using django. It is a &#34;Lost And Found&#34; website which can be used to either report or view the lost and found things. Losing things is very common for us, which made me to start this project :)

## Install
1.Install venv
```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```
2.Create a virtual environment
```sh
python3 -m venv virtual
```
3.Start the virtual environment
```sh
source virtual/bin/activate
```
4.Now your path will change and it will show the name of your virtual environment
```sh
(virtual)
```
5.Now install django,pillow and crispy-forms (required in this application)
```sh
pip install Django
pip install pillow
pip install django-crispy-forms
```

## Usage
1.Now clone the repository and change the directory to mysite and execute
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
2.You can access the website in your <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/">local host!</a>
